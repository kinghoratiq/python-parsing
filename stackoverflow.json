{"question": {"title": "C++ queue - simple example", "body": "\nI can't find simple example how to use queues in C++ for pointers to some myclass objects. I have code like this:\nclass myclass{\n  string s;\n};\n\nmyclass *p = new myclass();\n\nmy_queue.push(p);\n\n//something....\n\np = my_queue.front();\nmy_queue.pop();\n\nstd::cout << p->s;\n\nWhat should be declaration of my_queue? Should I use queue or another data structure?\nI need c++ just for small program, thanks for answers.\n", "authors": ["Ondra"], "upvotes": "23", "comments": [{"comment": "is this using your own queue implementation, or something else?", "author": "Tim Barrass", "upvotes": "\n2\n"}, {"comment": "i am using std::queue on linux, but i am lookig for any possible solution...", "author": "Ondra", "upvotes": "\n"}]}, "answers": [{"body": "\nSimply declare it as below if you want to us the STL queue container.\nstd::queue<myclass*> my_queue;\n\n", "authors": ["\nNim\n\n28.8k24786\n\n"], "upvotes": "40", "comments": [{"comment": "argh... seconds faster...", "author": "RedX", "upvotes": "\n3\n"}, {"comment": "@RedX: This one got my vote because it's more complete and mentioned STL.", "author": "Flexo\u2666", "upvotes": "\n"}, {"comment": "@awoodland: ...
